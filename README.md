# Data Engineering Zoomcamp
I will be following the [data-engineering-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and will be tracking my own progress here.

This study guide has been setup on weekly basis backed with a series of [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb).
